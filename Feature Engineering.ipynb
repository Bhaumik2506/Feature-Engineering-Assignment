    "**Q1. What is a parameter?**  \n",
    "A parameter is an internal variable of a machine learning model that is learned from the training data. In models like linear regression, parameters are the coefficients (weights) and intercepts that define the relationship between input features and output predictions. They are optimized during the training process using algorithms like gradient descent.\n",

    "**Q2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?**  \n",
    "Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase. A negative correlation means that as one increases, the other tends to decrease.  \n",
    "Negative correlation means that two variables move in opposite directions. For example, if time spent watching TV increases, and grades tend to decrease, these variables are negatively correlated. A correlation value of -1 represents a perfect negative relationship.\n",
